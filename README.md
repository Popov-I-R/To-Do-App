# To Do App


This is my first time writing code on Kotlin and I am very excited.
I just found this interesting YT tutorial and i just want to try it for fun. 

P.S. The app is done, I made everything step by step, but unfortunately i cant run it on Android Studio:

"The 'kotlin-android-extensions' Gradle plugin is deprecated and its no longer supported."

I've tried a few things but they didnt work.

I will keep trying to find a solution. 

Fingers crossed :)
